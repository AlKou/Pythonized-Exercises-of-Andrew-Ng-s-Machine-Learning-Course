## Pythonized-Exercises-of-Andrew-Ng-s-Machine-Learning-Course
Complete all the exercises of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera with pure Python code.



# Intro
**Andrew Ng**'s amazing Machine Learning course on Coursera is indeed a master piece, which has attracted millions of learners and the number is still counting!

But Andrew chose Octave/Matlab for this course, based on his analysis of course data indicating the fastest learning pace for learners when using Octave/Matlab.

For those who are beginners with only some experience of Python, or opt to Python more than other languages, surely such choice reslults in some inconvenience.

Therefore, I decided to re-do all the exercises using only Python.

All exercises would be completed using **Jupyter Notebook**, and as much as possible of the content of an exercise would be re-write in Python. Also the source data files would be uploaded with the notebooks.
