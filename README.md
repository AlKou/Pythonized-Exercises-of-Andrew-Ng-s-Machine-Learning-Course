## Pythonized-Exercises-of-Andrew-Ng-s-Machine-Learning-Course
Complete all the exercises of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera with Python.

# Intro
**Andrew Ng**'s amazing [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course on Coursera is indeed a master piece, which has attracted millions of learners and the number is still counting!

But Andrew chose Octave/Matlab for this course, based on his analysis of course data indicating the fastest learning pace for learners when using Octave/Matlab.

For those who are beginners with only some experience of Python, or opt to Python more than other languages, surely such choice reslults in some inconvenience.

Therefore, I decided to re-do all the exercises using only Python.

All exercises would be completed using **Jupyter Notebook**, and as much as possible of the content (including optional parts) of an exercise would be re-written in Python. Also the source data files would be uploaded with the notebooks and put in the same folder. 

Some of the exercises have 2 major topics, like Logistic Regression One-vs-All and Neural Networks of Exercise 3. I'd simply put all topics of the same exercise in just one Notebook for the sake of convenience. Also I'd markdown each exercise part following the original pipeline .m files. 

# Packages Version info:

-_Python_: **3.6.4**

-_Numpy: **1.16.4**
 
-_Scipy_: **1.0.0**

-_Matplotlib_: **2.1.2**

-_Seaborn_: **0.8.1**

-_Scikit-Learn: **0.19.1**

# Notes:

-_Occasionally I'd make some changes to the original exercises. Like the split of cost and gradient functions;_

-_Also I'd merge some functions. Like the K-Means plotting and training functions in Exercise 7;_

-_I'd add some content not in the original exercises as well. Like the use of different optimization algorithms for comparison;_

-_Some cells of the notebooks would take long to execute. Especially the runKMeans function in Exercise 7;_

-_Visualization sometimes is compromised due to platform difference and my technical skills limit._
